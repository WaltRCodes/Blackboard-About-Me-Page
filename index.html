      var txt1 = "Growing up in Queens, I was mystified about computers until my love for video games grew my interest in the technology behind it. Suddenly, my world opened up and I had a better understanding of the inner workings of applications. In my first semester at college, I led a team in a class project to create a game prototype. As a graduate, I am now persuing learning opportunities that will allow me to enter the software engineering space.";

      var txt3 = "I like video games, independent films, and conventions like Comic Con. Two interesting independent films I saw this year are The Lighthouse and Parasite.";
